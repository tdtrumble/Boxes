# Boxes
Rainmeter skin designed as a series of little windows. It's not designed to be super user friendly, there are no built in config pages. You will have to edit the .ini/.inc files to get everything working the way you want it. I did design the skins so that the majority of the code is hidden in .inc files that don't need altered and the skins themselves have anything that would need to be edited.

**Features**
* App Box
** Launches apps, folders, skins, shortcut files, etc
** Sweet rainbow effect
** Python script included to automate set up. There is a CSV file where you can input rows with the app/shortcut name, link, icon, then you can run the script and it will read the CSV file, create a copy of the template App Box, then plug in the values. Makes it MUCH quicker to set up a ton of boxes, otherwise you'll have to manually copy the App Box folder, rename it, and edit the .ini file to get it pointed to your apps.
